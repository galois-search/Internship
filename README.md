# OverView

This Repository includes files to generate PRN codes and generate some set of sequences using Decimation and Find all the Unique Sequences from the set

# File Description
- `MainCode_V11_02_07_2025.py` is the final code file to generate the sequences with given threshold in `10.txt` file which are length of sequence, acr value and balance.
- `10.txt` is for m = 10.
- `Decimation_V02.py` is to generate the Decimated Sequence set.
- `Filter_input_data_V02.py` is to apply the threshold for acr and balance values.
- `Acr_Bal_Program.py` is to calculate the acr and balance of a sequence.
- `CCR_function.py` is to calculate the CCR value of all sequences.
- `unique_sequence.py` is to find the unique sequences.
- Other `.txt` files are outputs.
- `m_sequence_generator_V2.py` is to generate sequence with m value using Shift Registers.
- `output_m9.xlsx` and output_m10.xlsx` files are the output in excel format with their m values and ACR and balance representing the count of Unique sequences before decimation and after decimation.
